Agora, a satirical and functional Ecommerce website, was built to incorporate the full stack technologies learned at Fullstack Academy remote immersive program. Technology utilized includes: React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and a PostGres database.

Due to the learning nature of the project and the short period of time to work on it 1.5 weeks in the program and an additional week after the program, it will likely stay incomplete.

Please reference the screenshots for UI/UX and the listed complete features below.
